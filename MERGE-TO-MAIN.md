# üö® ACTION REQUIRED: Merge to Main

## Current Situation

**‚úÖ v1.3.2 is stable, tested, and ready for production**

Current branch: `claude/simplify-game-symbols-011CUPEYbb3FNUpcjV2Gd3Ak`
- All tests pass ‚úÖ
- Music works ‚úÖ
- Match animations work ‚úÖ
- Comprehensive test suite included ‚úÖ

## The Problem

There are multiple stale branches and no proper `main` branch as the source of truth.

### Current Branches:

**Active (Good):**
- ‚úÖ `claude/simplify-game-symbols-011CUPEYbb3FNUpcjV2Gd3Ak` - v1.3.2 (current work)

**Stale (Bad):**
- ‚ùå `claude/github-game-prototype-011CUMBnvwesYGchJP9JLQBX` - Old prototype
- ‚ùå `claude/fix-screen-reflow-bug-011CUNeFGkX9exZDW5fGMBmm` - Old bug fix

**Missing:**
- ‚ùì `main` - Should exist as production branch

## What You Need To Do

### Option A: Via GitHub Web UI (Easiest)

1. **Go to GitHub repository**
   ```
   https://github.com/jedi-diah418/mobile-vibe-game
   ```

2. **Create a Pull Request**
   - From: `claude/simplify-game-symbols-011CUPEYbb3FNUpcjV2Gd3Ak`
   - To: `main` (create if doesn't exist)

3. **Review the PR**
   - Check all files are correct
   - v1.3.2 should be the version
   - CHANGELOG should be up to date

4. **Merge the PR**
   - Use "Squash and merge" or "Create a merge commit"
   - This will create/update `main` branch

5. **Set main as default branch**
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Branches
   - Set `main` as default branch
   - This ensures future PRs target main

6. **Delete stale branches**
   - Delete `claude/github-game-prototype-011CUMBnvwesYGchJP9JLQBX`
   - Delete `claude/fix-screen-reflow-bug-011CUNeFGkX9exZDW5fGMBmm`
   - Keep `claude/simplify-game-symbols-011CUPEYbb3FNUpcjV2Gd3Ak` until merge complete

### Option B: Manually via Command Line

```bash
# 1. Clone repo fresh
git clone https://github.com/jedi-diah418/mobile-vibe-game.git
cd mobile-vibe-game

# 2. Create main from current branch
git checkout claude/simplify-game-symbols-011CUPEYbb3FNUpcjV2Gd3Ak
git checkout -b main

# 3. Run tests to verify
./run-tests.sh
# Open test.html and verify all tests pass

# 4. Force push to create main (you may need admin access)
git push -f origin main

# 5. Set as default branch in GitHub
# Go to Settings ‚Üí Branches ‚Üí Switch default branch to main

# 6. Clean up stale branches
git push origin --delete claude/github-game-prototype-011CUMBnvwesYGchJP9JLQBX
git push origin --delete claude/fix-screen-reflow-bug-011CUNeFGkX9exZDW5fGMBmm
```

## After Main is Set Up

### Verify Deployment

1. Check GitHub Actions: https://github.com/jedi-diah418/mobile-vibe-game/actions
2. Ensure main branch deploys successfully
3. Visit live site and test:
   - Match animations work
   - Music plays
   - All 5 colors distinct
   - 7x7 board
   - Version shows v1.3.2

### Future Development

From now on:

```bash
# Always start from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create feature branch for each change
git checkout -b claude/feature-name-sessionid

# Make changes, test, commit
./run-tests.sh  # Must pass
git commit -m "Changes"
git push -u origin claude/feature-name-sessionid

# Create PR to main
# After review and tests pass ‚Üí merge to main
# Delete feature branch
```

## Why This Matters

**Without proper main branch:**
- ‚ùå No clear production source of truth
- ‚ùå Multiple orphaned branches
- ‚ùå Hard to track what's deployed
- ‚ùå Can't review changes properly
- ‚ùå Messy repository

**With proper main branch:**
- ‚úÖ Clear production code on main
- ‚úÖ Feature branches are temporary
- ‚úÖ Easy to review changes via PRs
- ‚úÖ Can enforce tests before merge
- ‚úÖ Clean repository

## Current Status

**Code Status**: ‚úÖ Ready for production (v1.3.2)
**Tests**: ‚úÖ All passing
**Branch Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs cleanup and main setup
