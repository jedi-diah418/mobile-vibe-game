All notable changes to Vibe Matcher will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.3.0] - 2025-10-23

### Changed
- **SIMPLIFIED GAME**: Reduced vibe types from 8 to 5 for easier gameplay
- **SMALLER BOARD**: Changed board size from 8x8 to 7x7 grid - less overwhelming, easier to scan
- **CLEARER SYMBOLS**: Replaced geometric symbols (‚óÜ‚óè‚ñ†‚ñ≤‚òÖ‚óà‚¨¢‚óâ) with simple heart emoji (‚ù§Ô∏èüíôüíõüíöüíú)
- **DISTINCT COLORS**: Replaced similar teal variants with 5 distinct primary colors:
  - Red, Blue, Yellow, Green, Purple
- Much easier for 8-year-olds and lazy adults to quickly identify matches
- Faster gameplay with fewer pieces to track
- Better mobile experience with larger pieces on smaller board

### Why These Changes?
Based on user feedback that 8 symbols with similar teal colors was confusing. New design focuses on simplicity and clarity - perfect for kids and casual play!

## [1.2.2] - 2025-10-22

### Fixed
- Fixed critical bug where score wasn't resetting when advancing to next level
- Players now start each new level with 0 points instead of carrying over previous level's score
- This prevents levels from auto-completing after one move

## [1.2.1] - 2025-10-22

### Fixed
- Fixed critical bug where level complete wasn't triggering when target score was reached
- `checkLevelStatus()` now called after `isProcessing` is set to false, ensuring game state is fully settled
- Added defensive checks in `checkLevelStatus()` to prevent duplicate triggers
- Removed redundant `checkLevelStatus()` calls from `processMatches()` and `triggerSpecialItem()`

### Changed
- Improved timing of level completion check for more reliable detection
- Level now completes immediately upon reaching target score, even with moves remaining

## [1.2.0] - 2025-10-22

### Added
- Tetris-style falling animations for new pieces
- Pieces now drop from the top with rotation and fade-in effects
- Staggered column delays create a wave effect when board refills
- Calculated fall distances based on actual row position

### Changed
- Replaced instant board refill with animated `renderWithFallingAnimation()`
- Enhanced visual feedback during cascading matches

## [1.1.0] - 2025-10-22

### Added
- Special power-up items system
  - üß® Dynamite: 3x3 explosion (50 points per piece)
  - üí£ Bomb: 5x5 explosion (150 points per piece)
  - ‚ò¢Ô∏è Nuclear: 7x7 explosion (300 points per piece)
- Seeded random number generation for deterministic levels
- Special items spawn with increasing probability as levels progress
- Pulse animations for special items
- Version number display in footer (bottom-right)

### Changed
- Enhanced screen shake intensity for special item explosions
- Special items trigger on swap instead of requiring matches

## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-22

### Added
- Initial release of Vibe Matcher
- 8x8 game board with 8 colorful vibe types
- Match-3 gameplay with cascading combos
- Mobile-friendly touch and swipe controls
- Tap-to-select-then-tap-to-swap mechanic
- Dark mode theme with teal/cyan color priority
- Pure black background (#000000)
- Geometric symbols (‚óÜ‚óè‚ñ†‚ñ≤‚òÖ‚óà‚¨¢‚óâ) instead of emojis
- Score tracking system
- Level progression with increasing difficulty (1.5x score target per level)
- 30 moves per level
- High score persistence using localStorage
- Screen shake effects (small/medium/big based on match size)
- Particle burst explosions on all matches
- Smooth swap animations with rotation and scaling
- GitHub Actions workflow for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages

### Fixed
- Safari mobile browser bar covering buttons (position:fixed solution)
- Touch events not working on mobile Safari (preventDefault with passive:false)
- Swipe detection not triggering swaps (proper touchmove/touchend handling)
- Board truncation on right side (max-width/max-height constraints)
- Board size too small on mobile (reduced padding, optimized sizing)

### Changed
- Allow ALL swaps to work, not just match-making swaps (enables combo setup)
- Board always allows swaps to enable strategic play
- Moves deducted for every swap regardless of match result

## Project History

### Development Journey

**Safari Mobile Challenges**: Multiple iterations were required to get touch controls working properly on Safari iOS. The final solution involved:
- Using position:fixed with simple 100% height (avoiding dvh units)
- Preventing default on ALL touch events with {passive: false}
- Lowering swipe threshold to 15px for better responsiveness
- Implementing tap-to-select-then-tap-to-swap fallback

**Game Mechanics Evolution**: Initially only match-making swaps were allowed (like Candy Crush), but this was changed to allow all swaps so players could set up bigger combo chains.

**Visual Polish**: Screen shake and particle effects were added to all matches, not just big ones, to make the game feel more responsive and satisfying ("juice").

**Theme**: Started with multi-colored hearts, evolved to dark teal theme with geometric symbols for better visibility and modern aesthetic.
